> People who believe in miracles are as miraculous as miracles.  
( 相信奇迹的人本身就和奇迹一样了不起 )

Welcome. I named my website "miraqlous" after the adjective word "miraculous". Initially I'd like a username that makes me encouraged and this quote suddenly came to my mind. More than surprisingly, by replacing "cu" with "q" I found my last name Qiu fully involved in the word miraculous. Perferct! So this website is created to record my academic experience and mirror how solid my academic background is. Please be my guest.
